currently using landingpage2.html and secondpage.html,
the other secondpages are there as history backups from before ro did relatively big changes to the html.


the secondpagenov22-1437 pair of css and html files
are with the flexboxes turned off and the original positioning system,
the dragging still doesnt work. I think it's something to do with
the tab hiding and showing, though im not covinced that flexboxes
will work with what we want to do.... (yes i know they were my implementation)

the secondpage css and html pair are currently the ones im using.
